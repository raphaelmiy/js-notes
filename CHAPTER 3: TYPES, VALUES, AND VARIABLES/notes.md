# CHAPTERS, VALUES AND VARIABLES

The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as types. When a programm wants to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to a variable.

JavaScript can be divided into two categeries: *primitive types* and *object types*. Primitive types include numbers, strings of text, and Boolean truth values.

The special JavaScript values **null** and **undefined** are primitive values, but they are not numbers, strings, or booleans. Each value is typically considered to be the sole member of its own special type.

ES6 adds a new special-purpose type, known as ***Symbol***, that enables the definition of language extensions without harming barkward compatibility.

Any JS value that is not a number, a string, a boolean, a symbol, null, or undefined is an object. An object (that is, a member of the type object) is a collection of properties where each property has a name and a value (either a primitive value or another object).
