# CHAPTER ONE NOTES AND CODE

Javascript's most important datatype is the object.

An object is a collection of name/value pairs, or a string to value map.

```javascript
let book = {                // Objects are enclosed in curly braces.
    topic: "JavaScript",    // The property "topic" has value "JavaScript"
    edition: 7              // The property "edition" has value 7
};                          // The curly brace marks the end of the object
```
